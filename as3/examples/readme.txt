To use these examples, you can:

1. Install - Copy the 'com' folder (containing all the classes) to your own classes folder and add that path to Flash's settings.

2. Play - Simply copy the 'com' folder into this directory.

How to use these:

Each .fla is an empty CS3 FLA set to the document class of the matching .as file, that contains all the ActionScript code. There are multiple demos in each file that require you to un-comment the specific lines in each example that make only that example work. If you publish the examples without un-commenting anything, it will do nothing, so you need to go through each and actually read the top of the .as files which explains how the packages work.
