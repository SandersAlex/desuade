Desuade Library Changelog
-------------------------

Release Candidate 1 (2009/7/29):
	
	[Not 100% compatible with Beta 3, some depreciations and changes]
	[Individual ease classes will be removed next revision, start using ease strings]
	
	Motion:
		-tween performance is now 5x faster! 2000 tweens: 11fps -> 53fps
		-added: toXML() and fromXML() methods to most classes
		-removed: clone() since you can use XML to duplicate now
		-changed: eases should now be entered as Strings - Bounce.easeOut -> 'easeOutBounce'
			eases can also be entered as functions, but will not work with XML and is not recommended
		-changed: tween constructors only require a target
		-added: eases.Easing class for passing eases as strings (now default)
		-changed: PrimitiveTweens no longer dispatch events (updateFunc and endFunc) for performance
		-changed: TweenEvent.UPDATED only gets dispatched if "update:true" is passed to the tween's config
		-fix: BasicMultiTween updated properties directly, effecting the tweenconfig
		-changed: MultiController duration/properties constructor order switched
		
	Partigen:
		-added: toXML() and fromXML() methods to most classes
		-changed: life is now: life and lifeSpread
		-changed: angle is now: angle and angleSpread
		-changed: eps is now a Number (not int), and allows for 1 emission greater than 1 second 
	
	Debugging: none
	
	Utils:
		-added: XMLHelper class
		

Beta 3 (2009/7/23):

	[Motion package not fully backwards compatible]

	Motion:
		-200% speed boost! Renders 2x as many tweens without performance hit
		-removed individual PrimitiveTween update sprite listeners - now uses a BasicTween loop update
		-added render() methods for PrimitiveTweens
		-PrimitiveTweens now do not run an update event automatically - you can use your own loop/timer/event to run render()
		-added BasicTween.ptid for the PrimitiveTween.id
		-Physics and Tween classes now separate 'target' from the tween config for constructor:
			new Tween(target, {property:'x', value:50, duration:2});
			new BasicPhysics(target, {property:'y', velocity:2});
		-updated controllers and sequencers to reflect API changes
		-Fix: KeyframeContainer.isFlat()  0 === '0' bug
		
	Partigen:
		-performance increase inherited from Motion Package
		-added SweepPool to remove particles at a set interval (performance effect unknown)
		-Fix: addColorTween always using 'color'
		-Updated debug codes
		
	Debugging: none
	
	Utils: none

Beta 2 (2009/7/03):

	[not backwards compatible at all]

	Motion:
		-rewrote controllers
			-major syntax change
			-ValueController now MotionController
			-PointsContainer now KeyframeContainer
			-Points are now Keyframes
			-PhysicsValueController now PhysicsMultiController
			-uses Keyframes instead of points (same concept, just more intuitive)
		-BasicPhysics now takes object like Tweens (unifying syntax)
		-Changed PhysicsEvent 'stopped' to 'ended'
		-added 'property' to BasicColorTween/ColorTween to allow for non-DisplayObject color tweening
		-added debug codes for BasicPhysics
		-lots of little tweaks

	Partigen:
		-rewrote controllers
			-major syntax change reflecting new Motion Package changes
			-better integration with new Motion classes
			-lots of little tweaks

	Debugging:
		-changed the replace character to % (instead of $)

	Utils: none
